# Welcome to NodeJS E-commerce

Hi! This is an e-commerce developed only for educational purposes, in which you can show a crud developed in Node. It has a data storage in JSON so it is preferable before using in production to make a proper connection.

# ATTENTION

This application does not have a **database connection** (SQL, MONGODB) or others and may not be ready for production without a suitable change. It has been made for educational purposes only. Currently the front end is not 100% responsive since it is not the current objective of the app.

## How to start?

Inside the app folder, run: **npm install** and then run **npm run dev**, the app starts at port: **3000**
